description: We all strive to write clean, concise, reusable code. Everyone's had a moment of looking at a 500-line file or a 50-line method and thinking, "This is just too much code!" There can be real joy in breaking a giant mess into small, tidy bits. But when does the quest for brevity lead us into a swamp of complication? Is there such thing as too LITTLE code? Can a method that does too little be just as dangerous as one that does too much? When we treat deleting lines of code as a good thing in and of itself, we run the risk of creating code that's harder to understand. Let's find the balance between extreme loquacity and excessive concision and then navigate the sensible middle path between less and more.
